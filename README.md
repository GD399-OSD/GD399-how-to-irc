# How to IRC
#### What the hell is IRC? How do I do it? What's it for?

Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a networked, decentralized chat service consisting of various Networks and Servers. It has been used by the open source community to organize, chat, and theorize for many years, and is baked into the fabric of open source technology and philosophies.

We'll be using a class IRC channel in addition to GitHub Issues to ask questions, answer questions, and chat about things related to class and open-source things in general. The hope is that doing everything, even online chat, in an open-source way, will teach us something about the potential value of forgotten and potentially arcane technologies.
