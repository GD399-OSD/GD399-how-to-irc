# How to IRC
### What the hell is IRC?

Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a networked, decentralized chat service consisting of various Networks and Servers. It has been used by the open source community to organize, chat, and theorize for many years, and is baked into the fabric of open source technology and philosophies.

### Why the hell are we using it?

We'll be using a class IRC channel in addition to GitHub Issues to ask questions, answer questions, and chat about things related to class and open-source things in general. The hope is that doing everything, even online chat, in an open-source way, will teach us something about the potential value of forgotten and potentially arcane technologies.

### How the hell do I use it?

This is the fun part (maybe). There are many ways to connect to IRC: using a web client, a desktop client, using TOR, or any other number of weird things. We'll focus on the easy one.

#### Registering Yourself
1. In your browser of choice, navigate to https://webchat.freenode.net/. This is a *web client* that allows you to collect to the *Freenode Network*, which is an IRC network meant exclusively for the discussion of open source things like OSS and open organizations.
2. Enter a nickname. This is what you will go by in our IRC Channel. I suggest using your first and last name, all lowercase, like this: `devinhalladay`.
3. In the `Channels` field, enter `#GD399-OSD`. This is the name of the IRC Channel just for our class.
4. Verify you're not a robot (or are you...?) and click "Connect".
5. Register your nickname so others can't take it. To do this, type `/msg NickServ register [password] [email]` into the text box at the bottom and hit enter. You'll get an email with a new message to send that verifies your identity. Copy the command, paste it into the message box, and hit enter. You're registered now! Nice.

#### Logging In ("Identifying" Yourself)
1. Every time you connect from now on, you'll need to "Identify" yourself so the server knows you're really you. Type `/msg NickServ identify [password]` and hit enter, and you should now be identified as a legit user of your chosen nickname.
